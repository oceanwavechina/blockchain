    Understanding Proof of Work
    A Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain.
    The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem.
    The number must be difficult to find but easy to verify—computationally speaking—by anyone on the network.
    This is the core idea behind Proof of Work.
